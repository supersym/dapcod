  "readme": "contracts.coffee\n================\n\ncontracts.coffee is a dialect of CoffeeScript with contract support.\n\nContracts allow you to write powerful runtime assertions about your code. \nLike types but less painful, like assert but more useful.\n\n    square :: (Num) -> Num\n    square = (x) -> x * x\n\n    # throws a run-time error\n    square \"a string\"   \n\nDocumentation, usage, and more examples: http://disnetdev.com/contracts.coffee/\n\nQuick start\n===========\n\nInstall via npm:\n\n    npm install -g contracts.coffee\n\nUse the compiler:\n\n    coffee -c --contracts /path/to/script.coffee\n\nAn alternative to using the --contracts flag is setting this env variable:\n\n    export CONTRACTS_COFFEE_ENABLED=1\n\nIf you are running in the browser then you'll need to load the \ncontracts library (found in [lib/contracts/contracts.js](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/tree/master/lib/contracts))\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"contracts.js\"></script>\n\nThere is also experimental support for require.js.\nSee [here](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/tree/master/test/webtest) for an example.\n\nIf you are running in node.js then you'll need to install the contracts.js package\n\n    npm install contracts.js\n\nNote that contracts.coffee requires some pretty new features of JavaScript \n([Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) \nin particular) so it currently only works on Firefox 4+, node.js 0.8.0+,\nand recent versions of Chrome (though you'll need to enable the\nexperimental JavaScript flag in about:flags).\n\nChange Log\n----------\n* [0.3.2](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/tree/c0.3.1) (September 5, 2012)\n  * disabling contracts for arrays (see issue [54](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/issues/54))\n  * various bug fixes\n* [0.3.1](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/tree/c0.3.1) (July 15th, 2012)\n  * support for stable node.js (v0.8.0+)\n  * some bug fixes\n* [0.3.0](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/tree/c0.3.0) (March 15th, 2012)\n  * [change](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/issues/8) to dependent function contracts\n  * various contracts.coffee bug fixes: [#27](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/issues/27), [#41](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/issues/41), [#33](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/issues/33), [#31](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/issues/31),\n  * various contracts.js bug fixes: [#9](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.js/pull/9), [#8](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.js/pull/8), [#7](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.js/pull/7), [#6](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.js/pull/6), [#5](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.js/pull/5), [#4](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.js/pull/4)\n  * experimental support for require.js (see [here](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/tree/master/test/webtest) for example use)\n  * based off CoffeeScript 1.3.1\n* [0.2.0](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/tree/c0.2.0) (January 4th, 2012)\n  * removed `.use()`, now using `Contracts.exports` and `Contracts.use`\n  * various bug fixes\n  * based off CoffeeScript 1.2.0\n* [0.1.0](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/tree/c0.1.0) (August 29th, 2011) \n  * initial release\n  * based off CoffeeScript 1.1.2\n",
