    DocPad is a language agnostic document management system. This means you
    write your website as documents, in whatever language you wish, and DocPad
    will handle the compiling, templates and layouts for you. For static
    documents it will generate static files, for dynamic documents it'll
    re-render them on each request. You can utilise DocPad by itself, or use it
    as a module your own custom system. It's pretty cool, and well worth
    checking out. We love it.
