Build tools
===========

This repository branch contains an in-depth perspective and documentation of any
build tools used in DocPad.

Additions
---------

Cakefile is replaced as a symbolic link to allow for experimentation and testing
on multiple files and versions.

This will allow for use of the `cake` command.

New suggestions can be added like Cakefile_Suggestion_NR_Name

`ln -s Cakefile_Suggestion_NR_Name Cakefile`
