This is just a simple test
==========================

That we may have found ourselves

  console.log "a working literate coffeescript"

This is automatically triggered by the indent

So for the rest we can use any other text as comments.

  class TestMeh

    constructor : () ->
      console.log "Hello world"

Now we can create a instance

  t1 = new TestMeh
  console.log "All done?"

Finally we can close the story.
